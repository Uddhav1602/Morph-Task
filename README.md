Morph-Task is a task management application built using React and Tailwind CSS.
It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete with real-time UI updates.
The app uses React Context API (useContext) for centralized and efficient state management.
State updates are handled immutably using map, filter, and the spread operator.
Tasks are persisted using localStorage, ensuring data remains after page refresh.
